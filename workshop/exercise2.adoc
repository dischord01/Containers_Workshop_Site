== Exercise Two - Working with Inventories

[IMPORTANT]
If you are having trouble creating an instance or two, shout loud and start waving your hands!

=== Creating Amazon Tags

Now that we all have our own vm's created, let's do some work with them. First off, we need a way to distinguish your systems from the other lab systems that we just created. Luckily, we've already thought of that for us.

Each instance that was created in EC2 had two tags attached to it as well. The first, `ansible_lab`, is the same for everyone. It allows us to easily find and remove these test instances at the end of our lab today. After all, EC2 is cheap, but it ain't free. :)

The second tag is called `user_id`, and is set to the value that you set when you ran you EC2 Creation Job.

The relevant part of the task is

----
  ec2:
...
    instance_tags:
      ansible_lab: true
      user_id: "{{ user_tag }}"
----

=== Leveraging Amazon Tags in Tower

After we created our instances we updated our EC2 Inventory. As part of this update, Tower pulled in all of the tags that are in EC2 and correlated them back to our Inventory. For each unique tag value, Tower auto-creates a group that we can leverage. You can access these groups through your Inventory.

They are created with the taxonomy:

`tag_tagname_tagvalue`

For example, for our `user_id` tag, when I used `jduncan` as the value in my Job Template, Tower created the tag `tag_user_id_jduncan`.

In the Inventories page, I can select these tag groups and do work on them as a whole.
