== Exercise Four - Creating a Job Template

At this point, we can confidently navigate and we have gone through (almost) all of the major concepts in Ansible Tower. The final scripted exercise we have scheduled for today is going through the process around creating a Job Template.

Like we talked about earlier, a Job Template takes all of the other components that are tracked in Ansible Tower and brings them together to do actual work. To do a job.

It's usually pretty straightforward.

The thing that you have to do, though, is account for ALL of the variables that your playbook needs. These either have to be account for in:

* your playbook role itself (in the code)
* in your Job Templates `Extra Variables` field
* in your Job Templates as a Survey

For this exercise, we will create a Job Template that will create local users on a given system. First, let's look at our playbook. For this we will be using link:https://github.com/bhirsch70/Ansible/tree/master/rhel_host_config[`rhel_host_config`] section in our GitHub repo.

.playbook
[source]
----
---
- name: setup rhel VM
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: true

  roles:
    - host_common
----

.host_common role tasks
[source]
----
---
- name: Add or remove user account
  user:
    name: "{{ item.name }}"
    group: users
    home: /home/{{ item.name }}
    password: "$6$rounds=656000$3s/q6j43TVMvo82J$CSZt.mYCTFADfParJDxYeiOM/AlovGpc1idDtehmpau6zQ94CBrMfuxaNyXhdk/t.kpgOOTw.9sueGrRttJrL0"
    state: "{{ user_state }}"
    remove: yes
  with_items:
    - "{{ users }}"
  tags:
    - users

- name: Force user with default password to change password at next login
  command: chage -d 0 {{ item.name }}
  when: user_state == "present"
  with_items:
    - "{{ users }}"
  tags:
    - users

- name: Add or remove yum packages
  package:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: "{{ package_state }}"
    use: yum
  with_items:
    - "{{ package_list }}"
  tags:
    - packages

- name: create the /etc/motd file
  template:
    src: motd.j2
    dest: /etc/motd
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: 0644
  tags:
    - motd
----

As we can see, the playbook calls the host_common role, and that role has several tasks that can be put together or seperated by their tags.

For this example exercise, we will create a job template that will add system users to our systems that will let us log in. Looking at the tasks with a `user` tag, we need to account for a few variables:

* users - a dictionary of users with a name value
* user_password - a password (encrypted)
* user_state - to feed into the ansible task. There are a few valid options here.

We will create a simple survey to handle all of this, along with prompting for our `Extra Variables` in the Job Template so we can dynamically create users for a given system or group of systems.

[TIP]
.A Few Important Items
====
* We don't need Cloud Credentials since we are ssh-ing directly into the system to make changes
* Notice the `Job Tags` field is referencing the `users` tag that is defined in the role. This way this Job will only execute those tasks.
