=== Setup

This lab is NOT a walkthrough of Ansible Tower's setup. To be honest, it's too simple.

* get a system of correct size
* register it with Red Hat
* subscribe it to the proper channels
* download a tarball containing the Ansible setup scripts
* fill a few variables out in an inventory file
* run `setup.sh`

`setup.sh` just calls a playbook that deploys Ansible Tower. Total setup for this lab took approximately 45 minutes, end-to-end.

=== End Result

The Ansible Tower we set up for this lab is at {tower_url}

=== First Login

You know you were successful if you are able to browse to your Tower's hostname and get some like

To log in, you use the admin password you set in your inventory file. It's just that easy!

== The Tower UI

In order to save a fair amount of time during this lab we have built out several of the constructs that Tower uses to organize itself into a enterprise, multi-tenant deployment tool. Instead of doing those live, we will walk through them quickly here so we can get to the good stuff sooner.

=== Settings

The `settings` menu (the little gear in the top right corner) is where you do a lot of your initial work to configure Ansible Tower. Within it are 8 options (9 if you include 'About')

We won't need to cover them all, but a few are key for us to be able to effectively use Tower today.

. Settings Options
* Organizations - Create Logical Organizations within Tower
* Users - Manage Users, including their permissions
* Teams - Create and manage Teams
* Credentials - Manage multiple types of credentials (more on that later)
* Management Jobs - cleaning up the Tower Database
* Inventory Scripts - Maintain dynamic inventory from your various cloud providers
* Notifications - Manage various kinds of notifications like Email, SMS, and Slack
