== Exercise One - Creating EC2 Instances

[IMPORTANT]
Be sure you can log in to {tower_url}. The email you used to register for this workshop should be your username and the password will be shown as part of the lab. If you can't log in start shouting loud and waving your hands!

Now that everyone can log into Ansible Tower (right?!), everyone will be able to create a few EC2 instances to use during our following labs. You should be able to see a job template called `Provision EC2 Instances`. Click the `launch` button next to it in the `Job Templates` screen.

[TIP]
Can you see the job we used to create all of the user accounts?

You will be prompted for a survey when you launch a Job based on this Job Template.

=== Playbook Tags

If you look at the link:https://github.com/bhirsch70/Ansible/blob/master/provision_ec2/roles/ec2_common/tasks/main.yml[playbook role that is being called], you will notice that the tasks have tags associated with them.

[source]
----
...
- name: Wait for SSH to come up
  local_action: wait_for host={{ item.public_dns_name }} port=22 delay=60 timeout=320 state=started
  with_items: "{{ ec2.instances }}"
  tags:
    - provision # <1>

- name: gather ec2 facts
  action: ec2_facts
  tags:
    - terminate # <2>
...
----
<1> provision tag
<2> terminate tag

The tags can be referenced in a playbook to limit which tasks in a role are called. It allows you to selectively run parts of roles without lots of messy logic. They are link:http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_tags.html[fully documented].

Inside a Job Template, you can use tags as well. In our EC2 Provisioning Job Template, we are only running tasks in the role that have a `provision` tag.

[TIP]
Job Templates can also prompt for Playbook Tags at launch. Even more ways to be dynamic and not have to repeat yourself!
